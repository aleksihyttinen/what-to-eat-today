# What to eat today?
This is an app where a user can submit foods they like and then get a random one from the list.  
The app is hosted at Azure: https://what-to-eat-today.azurewebsites.net/  
(It might take a while to open thanks to Azures free plan limitations)  

# Motivation
This app is a personal project of mine. We always struggle to decide what to eat today,  
so now you can have an app tell you what to eat instead of arguing about it.  

# Tech/Framework used
Frontend: React.js and Material UI  
Backend: Node.js and Express  
(both stacks with TypeScript)  
Database: Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB API

# Features
Add, remove, edit foods and get a random food from the user specified list with the click of a button.

# TODO  
Improve UI  
Add refreshtokens and redesing the database structure  
Move JWT tokens to cookies
